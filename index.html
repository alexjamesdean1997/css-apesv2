      <p>
        Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and
        development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based
        on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix
        of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS
        media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the
        website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image
        size and scripting abilities. One may also have to consider the settings
        on their devices; if they have a VPN for iOS on their iPad, for example,
        the website should not block the user’s access to the page. In other
        words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond
        to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different
        design and development phase for each new gadget on the market.

        <p>
          The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed
          as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer
          space distribution between items in an interface and powerful
          alignment capabilities. When we describe flexbox as being one
          dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout
          in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can
          be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which
          controls columns and rows together.

        <img src="./img/large/grid.jpg" alt="baby-monkeys" />
        <p>
          CSS Grid Layout excels at dividing a page into major regions or
          defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer,
          between parts of a control built from HTML primitives. Like tables,
          grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows.
          However, many more layouts are either possible or easier with CSS grid
          than they were with tables. For example, a grid container's child
          elements could position themselves so they actually overlap and layer,
          similar to CSS positioned elements.

    <!-- SECTION TRANSFORMS -->

      <div class="classic-div">
        <img src="./img/large/transform.jpg" alt="baby-monkeys" />
        <p>
          The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate
          an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual
          formatting model. If the property has a value different than none, a
          stacking context will be created. In that case, the object will act as
          a containing block for any position: fixed elements that it contains.
